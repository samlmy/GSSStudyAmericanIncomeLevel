# STA304 Paper 3
This is a project for the University of Toronto STA304 by Professor Rohan Alexandar.

In this project, I chose to conduct a statistical analysis on the 2021 General Social Survey from the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago using statistical programming language R. In order for you to produce the same results as I did, please follow the instructions below:

1. Download the Zip file onto your computer from this GitHub page
2. Open and run the 01-data_cleaning.R file on your local Rstudio or Rstudio.cloud to obtain the dataset
3. Open the paper.Rmd file in outputs/paper
4. Use the knit function in Rstudio to generate the pdf file of the report
